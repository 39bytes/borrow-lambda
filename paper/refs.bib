    abstract = {Rust is a new systems programming language that promises to
                overcome the seemingly fundamental tradeoff between high-level
                safety guarantees and low-level control over resource management.
                Unfortunately, none of Rust's safety claims have been formally
                proven, and there is good reason to question whether they
                actually hold. Specifically, Rust employs a strong,
                ownership-based type system, but then extends the expressive
                power of this core type system through libraries that internally
                use unsafe features. In this paper, we give the first formal (and
                machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a
                realistic subset of Rust. Our proof is extensible in the sense
                that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can
                say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it
                to be deemed a safe extension to the language. We have carried
                out this verification for some of the most important libraries
                that are used throughout the Rust ecosystem.},

    abstract = {The Rust programming language supports safe systems programming
                by means of a strong ownership-tracking type system. In their
                prior work on RustBelt, Jung et al. began the task of setting
                Rust’s safety claims on a more rigorous formal foundation.
                Specifically, they used Iris, a Coq-based separation logic
                framework, to build a machine-checked proof of semantic soundness
                for a λ-calculus model of Rust, as well as for a number of
                widely-used Rust libraries that internally employ unsafe language
                features. However, they also made the significant simplifying
                assumption that the language is sequentially consistent. In this
                paper, we adapt RustBelt to account for the relaxed-memory
                operations that concurrent Rust libraries actually use, in the
                process uncovering a data race in the Arc library. We focus on
                the most interesting technical problem: how to reason about
                resource reclamation under relaxed memory, using a logical
                construction we call synchronized ghost state.},
