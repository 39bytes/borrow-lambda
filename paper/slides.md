Consider the following C++ code
===

What does this print?

```cpp
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    int *num = &nums[2];
    nums.push_back(4);
    std::cout << *num << std::endl;
}
```

<!-- pause -->

Answer: undefined behavior!

```bash
ü™∑ borrow_lambda on Óú• main 
‚ùØ g++ test.cpp

ü™∑ borrow_lambda on Óú• main 
‚ùØ ./a.out
-1894668746

ü™∑ borrow_lambda on Óú• main 
‚ùØ ./a.out
-2120099788

ü™∑ borrow_lambda on Óú• main 
‚ùØ ./a.out
1710462087
```

Consider the following Rust code
===

What does this print?

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let num = &nums[2];
    nums.push(4);
    println!("{}", *num);
}
```

<!-- pause -->

Answer: compile error :)
```bash
ü™∑ borrow_lambda on Óú• main [1]
‚ùÆ rustc foo.rs
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `nums` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> foo.rs:4:5
  |
3 |     let num = &nums[2];
  |                ---- immutable borrow occurs here
4 |     nums.push(4);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("{}", *num);
  |                    ---- immutable borrow later used here

error: aborting due to 1 previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.

Why borrow checking? (motivation)
===

Manual memory management (like in C) is performant, but very error prone. We use automatic memory management strategies to make programming easier.

<!-- pause -->

- Garbage Collection
    - A second procedure whose job is to find unreachable values, and free their memory.
    - Different strategies, each with pros and cons (ref cycles, fragmentation).
    - Bottom line: we compromise performance for memory safety.

<!-- pause -->

- Borrow Checking
    - A set of rules enforced during compile time that prevent common memory errors from being able to happen.
        - dangling pointer
        - use after free
        - double free
        - null dereference
    - We can ensure our code is memory safe, without the runtime overhead of a garbage collector!

Why borrow checking? (background)
===
# Cyclone
- A research language from the early 2000s that was designed to provide memory safety to C.
- Main goal was to prevent vulnerabilities in C code (buffer overflow, incorrect typecasts, null pointer dereference) by attacking the semantics of the language itself.
- Introduces Regions to C: areas (scopes) where objects live and are deallocated simultaneously.
    - Region subtyping / "outlives" relation.
    - Prevents errors like null pointer dereferencing at compile time.
- A basis for Lifetimes, an important feature of the Rust borrow checker.
- Now a discontinued project, but many of Cyclone's features have been ported over to Rust.
- Region-Based Memory Management in Cyclone" (Grossman et al. 2002)

Ownership
===

- Rust's ownership is an implementation of something called an *affine type system*. What this means is that values can only be used at most once.
- This is a particular instance of the more general concept of **substructural type systems**. (elaborate)
